# Project Notes

## 2025.05.05

I finished Phase 0 of the Chess project successfully! I liked it, especially when building multiple classes, and they all work together.

While I scored 100% on the submission, my code quality is only at a 15%. Here are some things I will need to fix:

- Duplicate lines: (action plan: make a class for these type of pieces)
    - QueenMovesCalculator (line 37)
    - RookMovesCalculator (line 49)
    - BishopMovesCalculator (line 48)
- Duplicate block
    - PawnMovesCalculator (lines 97 and 105)
- Delete all old commented out code
- Nesting: maximum is 4
    - PawnMovesCalculator: line 70, 74, 75
- Line Length: maximum is 150 characters
    - ChessMove at line 54
